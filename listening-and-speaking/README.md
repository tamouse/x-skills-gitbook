  Thoughts after writing out Yolo Akili's passage from Dear Universe that
  includes the line "Love so all may be liberated."

# Listening and Speaking

### Listen first, to hear

When we listen, listen authentically, without agenda, with only seeking to connect, inquire, understand, and include, to let others liberate themselves and others, only then will we be able to be free.

### Speak after hearing, to include

When we speak, speak with authenticity, speak without agenda, speak to be heard, to be free, and to let others be free, we will only then allow the liberation of ourselves and others.

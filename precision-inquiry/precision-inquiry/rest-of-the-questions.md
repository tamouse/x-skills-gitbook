# Rest Of The Questions

The rest of the questions further specify the desired state:

* Under what circumstances would you _not_ want it?
* When do you want it by?
* Where do you want it; everywhere, all the time?
* With whom do you want it?
* What will you lose by having it?
* What stops you from having it today?
* What do you already have towards getting it?
* What else do you need in order to get it?
* What is the first step?

A final question is to check the Ecology of what the person wants:

> Given all _this_ \(backtracking\), do you still want it?

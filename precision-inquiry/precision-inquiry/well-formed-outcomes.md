# Well-formed Outcomes

In building a [Desired State](desired-state.md), the quality of the description of the outcomes is important to being able to achieve them.

**Assertion:** quality of life is dependent upon achieving one’s outcomes in life.

**Assertion:** the quality \(value to the person requesting something\) of one’s outcomes is in direct proportion to the _well-formedness_ of the outcome.

Outcomes have the following properties. All of these are necessary in order to make the outcome well-formed.

* **Specificity**: precisely stated action to be performed and result desired from the action. Specific as to outcome, form, place, time, cost, value, person\(s\):
  * **outcome:** what is the desired result from the action? The outcome itself must be stated. A complete picture of the [Desired State](desired-state.md) of the requestor is most useful.
  * **form:** what form will the result be needed in?
  * **place:** where will the action be performed and where will the result be delivered?
  * **time:** when is the result needed and how much time can the action take?
  * **cost:** what is the budget for carrying out the action and the cost of materials for the result?
  * **value:** how will the person performing the commitment be compensated and how will the requestor be using the result in future work?
  * **person:** who is making the request, the commitment response, carrying out the action, delivering the result, receiving the result, and using the result?
* **Obtainability:** the result must be able to be achieved by the person\(s\) within the specifications made.
* **Positive:** the commitment is for what is wanted, not what is not wanted. There are no statements of the form “Don’t do …” or “I don’t want…”. A positive outcome is easier and richer to specify than the list of things it isn’t supposed to be.
* **Appropriate chunk size:** the result requested can be negotiated in a single setting. The requestor must be able to use the result delivered
* **Ecological:** the outcome is not harmful to any of those involved, and furthers the goals and needs of the requestor.

# Precision Inquiry



Precision inquiry is the practice of establishing the most sensory-complete set of information the client can give you about what their [Desired State](https://tamouse.github.io/blog/pages/consulting/precision-inquiry.html#desired-state) will be. These questions can be asked from the present or the future; often times asking from the future is more productive especially if the client does not really consciously know what they want.

### Rest Of The Questions <a id="rest-of-the-questions"></a>

The rest of the questions further specify the desired state:

* Under what circumstances would you _not_ want it?
* When do you want it by?
* Where do you want it; everywhere, all the time?
* With whom do you want it?
* What will you lose by having it?
* What stops you from having it today?
* What do you already have towards getting it?
* What else do you need in order to get it?
* What is the first step?

A final question is to check the Ecology of what the person wants:

> Given all _this_ \(backtracking\), do you still want it?

# Levels of Experience

**Levels of experience** is a _model_ used to sort data into that gives a rich picture of the current and future states of an organization. The data we have gathered fits in one of the logical levels, and the relationships between these levels makes it clearer what people meant. Often two or more pieces of data may seem contradictory, but when sorted into logical levels make sense. Likewise, one can use the sorting to gain an understanding of the magnitude and type of change needed. In addition, threads of change become clearer, with various pieces of data at different logical levels supporting each other.

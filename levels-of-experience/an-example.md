# An example

The European Community is trying to align different European countries by working at the environment and behavior levels \(defining size of bananas, meat content of sausage, or setting tax levels or standard working hours\). What would it be like if EC focused on establishing a mission for Europe as a trading block or defined values such as protecting the oil industry or investing in new high technology?

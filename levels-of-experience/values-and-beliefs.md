# Values and Beliefs

What do people think is important?

**Examples**

* the work we do is important
* it is hard to change this place
* nobody beats us
* trust and respect for individuals
* achievement and contribution
* uncompromising integrity
* teamwork
* flexibility and innovation

Values and beliefs are principles that guide our actions and determine how we view ourselves, how we react to others, and what we make of our experience. Think about the rewards that really matter to people. Is it money? Doing something interesting? Learning? Being part of something important? A particular label, such as a title? Contributing to a particular mission? What is the organization rewarding?

What is often interesting is determine the difference between expressed values and practiced values.

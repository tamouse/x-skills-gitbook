# Precision Inquiry

Precision inquiry is the practice of establishing the most sensory-complete set of information the client can give you about what their [Desired State](https://tamouse.github.io/blog/pages/consulting/precision-inquiry.html#desired-state) will be. These questions can be asked from the present or the future; often times asking from the future is more productive especially if the client does not really consciously know what they want.

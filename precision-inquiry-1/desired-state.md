# Desired State

The goal of [Precision Inquiry](./), the _Desired State_, is a description of the client’s desired future, how they would like things to be.

It is typically derived by gathering [_Well Formed Outcomes_](well-formed-outcomes.md) for the future. One’s future desired state is very powerful for people to have; it provides a target for them to move towards, gives purpose for change and helps them determine what they need to know, acquire and do in order to get that desired future. The [_Three Golden Questions_](three-golden-questions.md) are often used to create a rich desired state for the client.
